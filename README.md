# Openlot E-commerce Sales & Performance Analysis

## Project Background  
Openlot Retail, established in 2014, is a global e-commerce retailer specializing in the sale of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG).  
As a data analyst at Openlot, I was tasked with creating an operational analytics package for Executives, Sales, Operations, and Finance to provide clear visibility into sales trends, product performance, regional performance, customer behavior, and payment patterns across 2014â€“2021.  

The dataset used for this analysis contains ~1,000,000 rows across six dimension/fact tables and covers the period from 2014 through 2021.  

**Key business metrics:**  
- Total Revenue  
- Quantity (units sold)  
- Active Customers  
- Average Unit Price (AUP)  

**Audience/Stakeholders:** Executives (CEO/CFO), Head of Sales, Head of Operations, Head of Supply Chain, Finance Manager, and Regional Managers  

**Insight Areas of this report):**  
- Overall Performance (monthly KPIs, YoY growth, Average Unit Price)  
- Product Performance (top units/categories)  
- Customer Insights (top customers, payment methods)  
- Regional & Global Performance (top countries, store divisions)  
- Supply Chain Insights (top suppliers)  

**The Excel queries, pivot models used for cleaning, and the dashboard can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tiDSgRcvXFr_uyY02QFXaEeMCuXdW-_Y?usp=drive_link)**

## Data Structure & Initial Checks  

The company's main database consists of six tables, with a total row count of ~1 million.  

**Tables (source CSVs):**  
- **customer_dim.csv** â€” `customer_key, name, contact_no, nid`  
  *Purpose: customer master table.*  

- **fact_table.csv** â€” `payment_key, customer_key, time_key, item_key, store_key, quantity, unit, unit_price, total_price`  
  *Purpose: transaction-level facts.*  

- **item_dim.csv** â€” `item_key, item_name, desc, unit_price, man_country, supplier, unit`  
  *Purpose: product master, including supplier and manufacturer country.*  

- **store_dim.csv** â€” `store_key, division, district, upazila`  
  *Purpose: store geography / regional attributes.*  

- **time_dim.csv** â€” `time_key, date, hour, day, week, month, quarter, year`  
  *Purpose: canonical time attributes for trend analysis.*  

- **trans_dim.csv** â€” `payment_key, trans_type, bank_name`  
  *Purpose: payment/transaction channel details (card, mobile, cash, etc.).*  

**Initial Checks:**  
- Rowcounts matched source CSVs (~1M total).  
- Date coverage validated: **2014â€“2021**.  
- Key joins validated:  
  - `fact_table` â†’ `customer_dim` (customer_key)  
  - `fact_table` â†’ `item_dim` (item_key)  
  - `fact_table` â†’ `store_dim` (store_key)  
  - `fact_table` â†’ `time_dim` (time_key)  
  - `fact_table` â†’ `trans_dim` (payment_key)  
- Null checks completed for critical fields (`total_price, quantity, unit_price, time_key`).  
- Small number of refunds/dates cleaned or excluded.

## Executive Summary  

### Overview of Findings  
Overall sales and volume have been stable across months with steady revenue growth driven by price/volume mix rather than new customer acquisition.  
- **Total Revenue:** $105M  
- **Total Quantity:** 6M units  
- **Total Customers:** 9.2K  

A small set of products, customers, suppliers, and regions account for a disproportionate share of revenue and units â€” prioritizing these high-performing segments will deliver the greatest near-term lift.
